The power liftgate market was valued at around $4 billion in 2020, and it is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. This market is driven by the increasing utilization of these components for decreasing the human effort in lifting heavy objects into vehicles, as liftgates use a powerful hydraulic system. They also help in saving manual labor costs and shortening the entire process. In addition, the rising demand for commercial vehicles with power liftgates in the logistics and transportation sector is set to support the growth of the market.

Another key factor that supports the growth of the power liftgate market is the rising demand for hands-free power liftgates, which have a specific switch locking mechanism, along with capacitive motion sensors integrated within the bumper of the vehicle, for smart access. The growing concern for vehicle and passenger safety is also driving the demand for power liftgates, thus leading to the development of the market. This is because conventional liftgates, which are operated manually, can often come down in an instant and hit someone on the head.

When segmented based on vehicle type, the passenger vehicle category is predicted to dominate the power liftgate market in the coming years. This is ascribed to the soaring demand for luxury vehicles because of the rising living standards of customers. Moreover, the demand for passenger vehicles with features such as liftgate lock systems, advanced sensor systems, and automatic door opening and closing is growing. Moreover, with the growing logistics sector, the sale of trucks and medium-duty vans is rising, thereby propelling the integration of power liftgates.

Globally, APAC is predicted to witness the fastest [growth in the power liftgate market](https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/power-liftgate-market) in the coming years because of the surging living standards and rising car sales in the region. Another significant factor supporting the growth of the market in this region is the increasing number of manufacturers offering customers convenience and comfort in their vehicles. The rising sales of electric vehicles, due to the strict emission regulations, and the soaring demand for autonomous vehicles are also pushing the market growth.

Thus, the rapid expansion of the automotive industry and changing preferences of customers are set to boost the market growth in the coming years.
