Hello,

I am writing on behalf of {{website}}. I am the webmaster of {{website}} and all of its subdomains.

I see you are filing a claim for {{Nitter instance url}}. {{Nitter instance url}} hosts Nitter, a private Twitter front-end, meaning it is simply a proxy to access Twitter assets and user generated content without tracking from Twitter. Thus, all content is proxied from Twitter and is not stored on our servers and if Twitter chooses to remove an asset, it will no longer appear on our site.

Our {{server hosting}} {{Nitter instance url}} is hosted in the European Union, so the European Union's laws apply. Under the directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonization of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society, "temporary acts of reproduction referred to in Article 2, which are transient or incidental [and] an integral and essential part of a technological process and whose sole purpose is to enable: a transmission in a network between third parties by an intermediary" is allowed, and legal. 

As such, all takedown requests must be sent to Twitter, as we don't have any control on the data that they have on their servers.

Thank you,
